# IMS Weather Story Automation Project

## Comprehensive Project Documentation

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025
**Project Status:** Phase 1 - XML Parsing & Data Extraction (Refinements In Progress)

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Goal

Build an automated Python script that:

1. Downloads daily weather forecast XML from Israel Meteorological Service (IMS)
2. Parses the forecast data for 15 Israeli cities
3. Generates a designed Instagram story image (1080x1920px)
4. Emails the image to the social media manager
5. Runs automatically every morning at 6:00 AM

### Background

- **Team:** IMS Social Media & Design Team
- **User Role:** Designer with basic technical skills, learning Python
- **End Goal:** Deploy on IMS servers after approval from CEO
- **Approach:** Build incrementally, one phase at a time

## 📋 Project Phases

### Phase 1: XML Parsing & Data Extraction 🔄 REFINEMENTS IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Successfully extract forecast data from XML file with robust automation

**Core Tasks:**

- [x] Install Python 3.13.2
- [x] Set up VS Code
- [x] Convert XML file to UTF-8 encoding
- [x] Verify Hebrew text displays correctly
- [x] Parse XML structure correctly
- [x] Extract city data (name, coordinates, temperatures, weather code)
- [x] Filter for specific date
- [x] Sort cities by latitude (north to south)

**Refinement Tasks (Current Focus):**

- [x] Create test extraction scripts (minimal & full)
- [x] Prove basic extraction works
- [ ] Build automatic XML download from IMS website
- [ ] Implement encoding conversion (ISO-8859-8 → UTF-8)
- [ ] Add archive management (keep 14 days of historical XML)
- [ ] Enhance extraction with error handling
- [ ] Create main workflow orchestration script
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging system
- [ ] Implement dry-run mode for testing
- [ ] Dynamic date handling (use today's date)
- [ ] Fallback to archived data if download fails
- [ ] Validate city count (expect exactly 15, warn if different)

**Major Breakthrough:** ✅ Successfully created working extraction scripts that extract all 15 cities and sort them north to south!

**Current Focus:** Building production-ready automation with download, archiving, error handling, and logging

### Phase 2: Single City Image Generation ⏳ NOT STARTED

**Goal:** Create proof-of-concept image with one city

**Tasks:**

- Set up Pillow library
- Load Google Font (Hebrew support)
- Create basic image canvas
- Render one city with: emoji icon, temperature, Hebrew name
- Handle RTL (right-to-left) text correctly
- Export as JPG

### Phase 3: Complete Design Implementation ⏳ NOT STARTED

**Goal:** Generate full 15-city forecast image

**Design Specifications:**

- Canvas: 1080x1920px (Instagram story size)
- Background: Gradient (blue → orange)
- Layout: 15 cities vertically, sorted north to south
- Each row: Semi-transparent rectangle, weather emoji, temperature range, Hebrew city name
- Font: Google Fonts with Hebrew support

### Phase 4: Scheduling & Email Delivery ⏳ NOT STARTED

- Daily scheduling (Windows Task Scheduler)
- 6:00 AM execution
- Email functionality
- Error handling and logging

### Phase 5: Server Compatibility ⏳ FUTURE

- Test on IMS servers
- Linux compatibility if needed
- Deployment documentation

## 🗺️ Data Structure Reference

### XML Structure

```xml
<IsraelCitiesWeatherForecastMorning>
    <Identification>
        <IssueDateTime>2025-09-28 04:46</IssueDateTime>
    </Identification>
    <Location>
        <LocationMetaData>
            <LocationId>520</LocationId>
            <LocationNameEng>Elat</LocationNameEng>
            <LocationNameHeb>אילת</LocationNameHeb>
            <DisplayLat>29.55</DisplayLat>
            <DisplayLon>34.9</DisplayLon>
        </LocationMetaData>
        <LocationData>
            <TimeUnitData>
                <Date>2025-09-28</Date>
                <Element>
                    <ElementName>Maximum temperature</ElementName>
                    <ElementValue>39</ElementValue>
                </Element>
                <Element>
                    <ElementName>Minimum temperature</ElementName>
                    <ElementValue>26</ElementValue>
                </Element>
                <Element>
                    <ElementName>Weather code</ElementName>
                    <ElementValue>1580</ElementValue>
                </Element>
                <!-- More elements... -->
            </TimeUnitData>
            <!-- 3 more TimeUnitData blocks for following days -->
        </LocationData>
    </Location>
    <!-- 14 more Location blocks -->
</IsraelCitiesWeatherForecastMorning>
```

**Key Points:**

- Each `<Location>` represents one city
- Each city has 4 `<TimeUnitData>` blocks (4-day forecast)
- Each `<TimeUnitData>` has a `<Date>` element
- Weather data is stored in `<Element>` tags with `<ElementName>` and `<ElementValue>`

### Cities Data

**15 Cities (Alphabetical in XML):**
Elat, Ashdod, Beer Sheva, Bet Shean, Haifa, Tiberias, Jerusalem, Lod, Mizpe Ramon, Nazareth, En Gedi, Afula, Zefat, Qazrin, Tel Aviv-Yafo

**Required Sort Order (North to South by Latitude):**

1. Qazrin (33.0°N)
2. Zefat (33.05°N)
3. Bet Shean (32.45°N)
4. Tiberias (32.8°N)
5. Haifa (32.82°N)
6. Nazareth (32.75°N)
7. Afula (32.52°N)
8. Tel Aviv-Yafo (32.1°N)
9. Lod (31.85°N)
10. Ashdod (31.84°N)
11. Jerusalem (31.78°N)
12. En Gedi (31.42°N)
13. Beer Sheva (31.25°N)
14. Mizpe Ramon (30.61°N)
15. Elat (29.55°N)

### Weather Codes

Weather codes are numeric values that need to be mapped to emoji icons. Examples:

- 1250: Clear/Sunny
- 1220: Partly Cloudy
- 1310: Mostly Clear
- 1580: Very Hot/Sunny

**Note:** Full weather code mapping needs to be researched from IMS documentation.

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### Language & Libraries

- **Python 3.13.2:** Main programming language
- **xml.etree.ElementTree:** XML parsing (Python standard library)
- **Pillow (PIL):** Future image generation
- **datetime:** Date handling

### Encoding

- **Issue:** Original XML had encoding problems with Hebrew text
- **Solution:** Converted to UTF-8 encoding
- **File:** `isr_cities_utf8.xml` is the working version

### Design Approach

- Build incrementally, test each component
- Start with console output before moving to image generation
- Focus on getting Phase 1 working completely before moving forward

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

### ✅ Resolved Issues

#### Issue #1: Zero Cities Extracted - RESOLVED

- **Original Problem:** Script reported finding 15 cities but extracted 0 cities' worth of data
- **Solution:** Created minimal test scripts that successfully extract data from all 15 cities
- **Current Status:** Extraction working perfectly with both test scripts

### ⚠️ Outstanding Items

### Item #1: Weather Code Mapping

- **Status:** Partial understanding
- **Known Codes:**
  - `1250` - Clear/Sunny
  - `1220` - Partly Cloudy
  - `1310` - Mostly Clear
  - `1580` - Very Hot/Sunny
- **Next Steps:** Research complete IMS weather code documentation or reverse-engineer from historical data

#### Item #2: Production Script Error Handling

- **Status:** Not yet implemented
- **Needed:** Robust error handling for download failures, network issues, malformed XML, missing data
- **Priority:** High - needed before automation

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

### When Moving to Phase 2

- Research Google Fonts with Hebrew support (Rubik, Heebo, Alef are good options)
- Test RTL text rendering in Pillow
- Consider using PIL.ImageDraw for text placement

### For Email Functionality (Phase 4)

- Use `smtplib` for sending emails
- Store credentials securely (environment variables)
- Add error notifications if script fails

### For Server Deployment (Phase 5)

- Test on Linux environment
- Document all dependencies in requirements.txt
- Create deployment guide for IT team
