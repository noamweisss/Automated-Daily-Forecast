# Development Guides

Helper guides created during the development process. These are **not required for the finished product** but may be useful for future development or onboarding new team members.

## Git & GitHub Guides

### Version Control Setup
- **[Git Guide](GIT_GUIDE.md)** - Basic Git commands and workflow for beginners
- **[GitHub Setup](GITHUB_SETUP.md)** - Comprehensive guide to setting up GitHub with VS Code
- **[Quick Start GitHub](QUICK_START_GITHUB.md)** - Quick reference for publishing to GitHub
- **[Next Steps](YOUR_NEXT_STEPS.md)** - GitHub publishing checklist and next steps

## Purpose

These guides were created during Phase 1-2 development to help with:
- Setting up version control (Git)
- Connecting to GitHub
- Creating commits and managing branches
- Publishing the project to GitHub

## Note

The main project documentation is located in the parent [docs/](../) folder. These development guides are supplementary resources that won't be needed for the production deployment but are preserved for reference.
