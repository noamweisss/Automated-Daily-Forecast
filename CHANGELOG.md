# Changelog

All notable changes to the IMS Weather Forecast Automation project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.1.0] - 2025-11-10

### Added
- **Daily Random Gradients:** The forecast image background now features a new, randomly selected gradient every day, adding visual variety.
- **Gradient Test Mode:** A new script `test_gradients.py` was added to generate a set of test images with different gradient backgrounds, allowing for easy visual testing of new color schemes.

### Changed
- **Separator Lines:** The separator lines between cities in the forecast image are now solid black for improved accessibility and visual consistency, replacing the previous adaptive color logic.
- **`send_email.py`:** This file, which used the SendGrid API, is no longer the primary email module. The project now uses `send_email_smtp.py`.
- **`.gitignore`:** Updated to ignore development guides, IDE-specific documentation, and dry-run output images.

### Fixed
- **Email Module Import:** The import of the email module is now conditional, allowing the project to run in environments where email dependencies are not installed (e.g., for testing image generation only).
- **Dry-Run Mode:** The dry-run mode has been enhanced to generate test images without requiring email configuration, making it easier to test the image generation pipeline.
