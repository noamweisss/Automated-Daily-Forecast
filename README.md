# IMS Weather Forecast Automation

> Automated daily weather forecast generator for Israeli cities - from IMS data to Instagram-ready stories

## Overview

This project automates the creation of daily weather forecast images for the Israel Meteorological Service (IMS) social media accounts. It downloads forecast data from IMS, processes it, and generates beautifully designed Instagram story images featuring 15 major Israeli cities.

    Then, edit the `.env` file with your credentials.


### Usage

#### Run the complete workflow
```bash
# Download today's forecast, generate the image, and send the email
python forecast_workflow.py

# Preview without making changes (dry-run mode)
python forecast_workflow.py --dry-run

# Extract data for a specific date
python forecast_workflow.py --date 2025-10-15
```

#### Run individual components

**Download XML from IMS:**
```bash
python download_forecast.py
```

**Extract forecast data:**
```bash
python extract_forecast.py
python extract_forecast.py --date 2025-10-15
```

**Generate forecast image:**
```bash
python generate_forecast_image.py
```

**Send the forecast email:**
```bash
python send_email_smtp.py
```

**Test gradient generation:**
```bash
python test_gradients.py
```

**View logs:**
```bash
tail -f logs/forecast_automation.log
```

### GitHub Actions Automation

The project is configured to run automatically via GitHub Actions:

**Scheduled Execution:**
- Runs daily at 6:00 AM Israel time (3:00 AM UTC)
- Downloads latest forecast from IMS
- Generates Instagram story image
- Sends email to configured recipients via SMTP

**Manual Execution:**
- Go to: Actions → IMS Daily Weather Forecast → Run workflow
- Choose dry-run mode to test without sending email
- View generated images in workflow artifacts

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
Configure these in: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
1. `EMAIL_ADDRESS` - Your sender email address
2. `EMAIL_PASSWORD` - Your email account password or app password
3. `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` - The recipient's email address
4. `SMTP_SERVER` - Your SMTP server address
5. `SMTP_PORT` - Your SMTP port

**Monitoring:**
- View workflow runs: Actions tab
- Download artifacts: Generated images and logs available for 90 days
- Email notifications: GitHub sends email on workflow failures

## Configuration

### Data Processing
Key settings are defined in [utils.py](utils.py):

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS` | 14 days | How long to keep historical XML files |
| `EXPECTED_CITY_COUNT` | 15 cities | Number of cities we expect in the data |
| `XML_FILE` | `isr_cities_utf8.xml` | Main working XML file |

### Image Generation
Design settings in [generate_forecast_image.py](generate_forecast_image.py):
- **Open Sans Font**: Variable axes (weight 300-800, width 75-100)
- **Image Size**: 1080x1920px (Instagram story format)
- **Header**: 180px white section with logo and date aligned to list edges
- **Layout**: Vertically centered city list with balanced padding
- **Weather Icons**: 65px iOS-style emoji PNGs per city row
- **Cities**: All 15 cities in single image
- All visual parameters configurable via constants at top of file

## Logging

All operations are logged to:
- **Console:** Real-time feedback during execution
- **Log file:** `logs/forecast_automation.log` (persistent record)

Log levels: INFO, WARNING, ERROR

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test minimal extraction (1 city)
python exploration/test_extraction_minimal.py

# Test full extraction (all 15 cities)
python exploration/extract_all_cities.py

# Inspect XML structure
python exploration/inspect_xml.py
```

## Version Control

This project uses Git for version control. See [GIT_GUIDE.md](docs/dev-guides/GIT_GUIDE.md) for basic Git commands and workflows.

### Version History
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed version history.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`
**Solution:** Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Problem:** Hebrew text displays as gibberish
**Solution:** Ensure the XML file is UTF-8 encoded. The download script handles this automatically.

**Problem:** No cities extracted
**Solution:** Check that the target date exists in the XML file. IMS provides 4-day forecasts.

**Problem:** Workflow fails to download XML
**Solution:** Check internet connection. The script will automatically fall back to archived XML if available.
